      If you use Sage in a book, paper, website, etc., please
      <a href="../contact.html">contact us</a> about details of the
      publication, e.g. where it is published, provide a link to your
      publication. Please reference Sage as
      <a href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE">described

      Also, be sure to find out which components of Sage, e.g. NumPy,
      PARI, GAP, Sage-Combinat, that your calculation uses and
      properly attribute those systems. If you are unsure, ask on the
      <a href=
      "http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">sage-support</a>
      mailing list. Similarly, consider finding out who wrote the Sage
      code you are using and acknowledge them explicitly as well.
