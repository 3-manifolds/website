 <h1 class="narrow">Annual Spies Sage Development Prize</h1>

 <div class="narrow">
  The Spies Sage Development Prize is an annual award worth $500 that will be given to a person who
  makes major and inspiring contributions to the development of the Sage Mathematical Software
  System. The goal of the prize is to acknowledge the recipient and to encourage him or
  her to continue to do excellent development work on Sage. It is funded by donations to the Sage
  Foundation by Jaap Spies, and cannot be awarded to the same person twice.

<h2 class="narrow">2013 Spies Prize: Jeroen Demeyer</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<b>Jeroen Demeyer</b> has provided excellent service to the Sage community as
release manager, starting with Version 4.6.1 in January 2011, just
five months after his first code contribution.  He has continued to
contribute significant code to the Sage library in the area of number
theory, including over forty contributions related to the fundamental
Sage package of PARI.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
Jeroen is everything the Sage community could ask for in a release
manager.  He is a trusted custodian of the code and has built an
impressive system for frequent beta and final releases.  He works
carefully with developers and users to balance the priorities of
fast-paced cutting-edge development, backwards compatibility,
portability, and high-quality software.  During his tenure as release
manager, he has earned great respect while making difficult decisions
as he shaped the Sage that the world sees.  His efficient, timely,
fair and knowledgeable work has won him the admiration of the Sage
development community and has rendered a great service to the much
larger user community.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his conscientious and technically excellent work as Sage release
manager, and his significant contributions to the Sage library, Jeroen
Demeyer is awarded the 2013 Spies Prize.
</div>

<h2 class="narrow">2012 Spies Prize: Jason Grout</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<strong>Jason Grout</strong> is a constant presence across the
Sage landscape.  He is extremely active in the discussion groups, comments on
many tickets, contributes code to the core Sage library, improves the
documentation, and works tirelessly to improve the notebook interface.  He
contributes in many ways to make Sage a better tool for mathematics
research, but he is perhaps most recognized for his efforts to make
Sage an effective tool for teaching mathematics.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
Jason's mathematical tastes have resulted in major code contributions
for linear algebra, graph theory, plotting and symbolics.  These are
all important areas for the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  But
he is equally interested in Sage infrastructure, such as LaTeX
representation, usability improvements to Trac server, format and
delivery of documentation, and NumPy/SciPy integration.  With a strong
background in web applications, his work on the notebook interface is
both visionary and technically strong.  A recent project he runs is
the Sage Cell Server, which allows a remote server to accept Sage code
and return results without any account or login.  This can power
interactive demonstrations on web pages or computations via mobile
devices, and the principles and implementations will be used in
increasing the scalability of Sage servers.  As an example of his
interest in education, this project has involved several undergraduate
students in significant ways.  Jason also gives freely of his time to
help other users and developers.  He is the second most numerous
poster of all time in the sage-support forum, in the top five for the
sage-devel, sage-edu and sage-notebook forums, and he has the
fifth-highest karma at the Ask Sage site.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his significant and inspiring technical contributions, his massive
contributions to the vitality of the Sage community, his work on
making Sage available via the notebook and cell servers, and his
interest in education, Jason Grout is awarded the 2012 Spies Sage
Development Prize. This award carries a prize of $500 from the Sage
Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies).

<h2 class="narrow">2011 Spies Prize: Robert Bradshaw</h2>

<div class="narrow">
<strong>Robert Bradshaw</strong> has been an extremely active and productive Sage
developer for over five years.  Additionally, he has been a leader,
both in maintaining the community and in important design decisions.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
He is probably best known for his work on Cython, which is critical for
the performance of many key parts of Sage, and his work designing and
implementing the coercion model, which makes many powerful
mathematical constructions possible. However, his interests and
significant contributions are wide-ranging, including: exact linear
algebra, arithmetic of elliptic curves, L-functions, 3-D plotting and
parallel building.  A recent project is the patchbot tool, which
automates testing contributions posted on trac.  Moreover, he is an
important contributor to trouble-shooting and design discussions in
the sage-devel forum and is also the third most numerous poster of all
time in the sage-support forum.
</div>
<div class="narrow">
For his many important technical contributions, and his long-time and
continuing involvement in the Sage community, Robert Bradshaw is
awarded the 2011 Spies Sage Development Prize.  This award carries a prize
of $500 from the Sage Foundation (thanks to Jaap Spies).
