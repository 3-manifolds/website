Sagemath.org Website
====================

The `src` contains the sources for the files,
they are rendered to fill-in the blanks for the templates
and the output is placed into `www`.

There are various support scripts for processing the data sources
and a `makefile` to help working with it.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure to not only clone from here or your fork,
but also to initialize all
[submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:sagemath/website.git

or if you forgot the `--recursive` switch, do this:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Later, don't forget to not only update the `website` project,
but also the submodules
(or whatever it is the right thing to do).

Development
-----------

The websites needs various data-sources to build its pages.
For example, the publications pages use HTML snippets
generated by the `publications` submodule.

Ideally, a courageous `make` should do everything for you
and and additional `make open` opens up your web-browser
to inspect the result.
